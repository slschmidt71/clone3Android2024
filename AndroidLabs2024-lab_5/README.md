Readme for Lab 2
================

Lab 2 Git Branch location: https://github.com/slschmidt71/AndroidLabs/tree/lab_2


These are the steps to run my Lab 2, after downloading the Lab 2 code:


1. To run my Lab 2 code, you must open the AndroidManifest.xml (see attached screenshot in Lab 2 Dropbox submission). The AndroidManifest.xml file is located in the Android Studio Project here: AndroidLabs\app\src\main

Change the name property to be: android:name=".MainActivityConstraint" or 
android:name=".MainActivityLinear"  or
android:name=".MainActivityGrid"

and Save AndroidManifest.xml

Note: Changing the name property in the AndroidManifest.xml will set the layout depending on which layout you want to run.

2. Next, open the corresponding layout java file and run. 

a. To run ConstraintLayout, open MainActivityConstraint.java. Then right-click and press run "MainActivityConstraint"

b. To run LinearLayout, open MainActivityLinear.java. Then right-click and press run "MainActivityLinear"

c. To run GridLayout, open MainActivityGrid.java. Then right-click and press run "MainActivityGrid"
